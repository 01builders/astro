# Astro

Astro is a minimalist consensus client that plugs directly into Cosmos SDK applications via ABCI. Inspired by Commonware’s Alto, it aims to be small, auditable, and easy to embed.

## Motivation

Cosmos chains typically rely on CometBFT for consensus. Astro aims to be an alternative implementation—written in Rust—that developers can swap in without touching their existing application logic.
